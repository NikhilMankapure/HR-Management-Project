# HR-Management-Project
This project is undertaken under the guidance of codebasics and the data for the company is provided by codebasics for the reporting purpose.
The report contains the presnece of employees and their analysis of sick leave and work from home percentage.
The insights that can be taken from the report will be crucial to understand the trend of leaves and accordingly dig down the line to find the reasons for the unwanted trends.
The insights can further help us to know the days with maximum present percentage to conduct weekly meets in a more comfortable and interactive way.
